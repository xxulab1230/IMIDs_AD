Investigating Immune-Neurodegenerative Crosstalk in Alzheimer's Disease
Overview
This study examines the complex interplay between immune-mediated diseases (IMIDs) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), focusing on shared genetic architecture, causal mechanisms, and therapeutic implications. By integrating multi-omics data and advanced computational approaches, we aim to clarify how dysregulated immune pathways influence AD pathogenesis and identify actionable targets for intervention.

Research Objectives
Causal Inference: Establish bidirectional causal relationships between IMIDs and AD risk.
Mechanistic Insights: Identify shared genetic variants and biological pathways linking immune dysregulation to neurodegeneration.
Therapeutic Discovery: Prioritize druggable genes and evaluate drug candidates through computational approaches.
