**Investigating Immune-Neurodegenerative Crosstalk in Alzheimer's Disease**

**Overview**
This study examines the complex interplay between immune-mediated diseases (IMIDs) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), focusing on shared genetic architecture, causal mechanisms, and therapeutic implications. By integrating multi-omics data and advanced computational approaches, we aim to clarify how dysregulated immune pathways influence AD pathogenesis and identify actionable targets for intervention.

**Research Objectives**
   
    1. Causal Inference: Establish bidirectional causal relationships between IMIDs and AD risk.
    
    2. Mechanistic Insights: Identify shared genetic variants and biological pathways linking immune dysregulation to neurodegeneration.
    
    3. Therapeutic Discovery: Prioritize druggable genes and evaluate drug candidates through computational approaches.

**Methodology Framework**
1. Causal Relationship Mapping
    Bidirectional Mendelian Randomization (MR):
    Evaluate causal effects between IMIDs and AD using genome-wide significant variants as instrumental variables.
    Adjust for confounding factors (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities).
    
    Bayesian Colocalization:
    Identify genetic loci with shared causal variants between IMIDs and AD (PP.H4 > 0.8).

2. Multi-Omics Integration
    Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA):
    Annotate enriched pathways in immune-neurodegenerative crosstalk (e.g., neuroinflammation, amyloid processing).
    
    Tissue-Specific eQTL Analysis:
    Map regulatory variants to gene expression in brain and immune tissues (e.g., prefrontal cortex, peripheral blood).

3. Predictive Modeling
    Machine Learning Integration:
    Train models combining polygenic risk scores (PRS) and immune gene expression to predict AD progression.
    Validate across independent cohorts.

4. Mechanistic Validation
    Mediation Analysis:
    Quantify the role of key genes in mediating AD pathology (amyloid-beta, tau).
   
    Structural Equation Modeling (SEM):
    Map hierarchical relationships between genetic variants, molecular pathways, and clinical outcomes.

6. Therapeutic Prioritization
    Drug Enrichment Analysis:
    Screen FDA-approved compounds targeting prioritized genes.
    
    Molecular Docking:
    Evaluate binding affinities of candidate drugs to protein targets.
